# Techlore VPN Reviews
***Transparent, community-driven VPN reviews.***

In the privacy world, companies and customers are looking for one-stop shops for privacy and anonymity, making VPNs one of the most over-marketed and untransparant industries to-date.

We’ve developed a community-driven process of systematically reviewing VPNs, while offering resources to educate individuals on VPN providers.

If you simply want to see our VPN results, ***here's a simple ranking*** for all services we've reviewed. 

## Our Review Protocol & Testing Methodology
We make our VPN reviews systematic to exclude as much bias as possible. You’ll find our ***review protocol here***; the best part is you are able to modify our percentages and scoring to fit your individual needs.  

For testing methodology, you’ll find exactly how we test VPNs ***in this document.***

Lastly, you'll find the current status of VPN reviews we are performing, as well as future ones ***here.***

## World-Wide VPN Speed Team
Most speed tests on the internet are fundamentally useless, as speeds are predominantly dictated by a user’s location and the server they are connecting to. A reviewer testing a VPN from San Jose can get drastically different results than a user testing the same VPN in Australia.

We are working on to address this issue with a world-wide VPN speed team. This will:
* Average-out speed results worldwide to confidently say VPN X is faster than VPN Y (on average)
* Offer data for individual countries (and sometimes states) so users within those locations can view the speeds of a VPN within their general location. 

This is a massive project with a plethora of logistical issues. We’ve already completed two rounds (that were successful), but many improvements must be made to continue scaling the project.

You’ll find more information on the ***VPN speed team here.***

## Affiliate Plans & Sponsorships
*This readme is brought to you buy NordVPN...* ***NOT***

Sponsorships can be fine, but they've led to massive amounts of misinformation, fake and/or biased reviews, & other...questionable practices. (We could write an entire article on the VPN industry)


***We have not and will never be sponsored by a VPN provider. Period.***


Because services are reviewed systematically, we are able to set transparant affiliate standards. We opt to use affiliations for services who meet certain requirements:
* Our first requirement is a minimum score of 4.20/5 in the review protocol. If a VPN scores any less, we are unable to offer an affiliate link.
* Affiliate plans are never considered during testing, and services without an affiliate plan are equally likely to perform the same as a non-affiliate service.
* Affiliate plans are never hidden. We include both a standard link and an affiliate link in our reviews, clearly labeled. If a user doesn't want to support us--they have the ***choice*** not to. 
* Even if a VPN scores 4.20/5 or higher, it must also pass our standard channel affiliate requirements ***found here.*** 
* If all safeguards fail, we hold ever right to cancel affiliate plans we deem to violate community trust. 

Affiliate plans are our largest source of income, so being able to utilize them transparantly and in a way where users have the ***choice*** to use them is how we are able to do this for a living.

## Review Protocol Changelog
Our review protocol is constantly evolving. We are continually accepting community feedback to find ways of making our testing as accurate as possible. You'll find all the changes we've made over the years ***here.***
